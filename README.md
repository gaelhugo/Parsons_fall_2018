<b>1. The Cultural Clock</b><br/>
The aim of that clock is to provide access to a various amount of cultural content.<br/>
The students will have to customize it (design & content) depending on their JS/HTML/CSS skills.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Step 1</b> (for Week 4: Sept. 19)<br/>
<br/>
Think independently about a concept related to "cultural clock" and take a look at the code's structure.<br/>
Begin to collect the data necessary to build your cultural clock design (images, video clips) and remember to keep it simple. Try to locate a project partner with whom you can work to create a shared vision.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Step 2</b> (Week 5: Sept. 26)<br/>
 Workshop in class about how to make the technical modifications to build a new clock concept. You must have your data set ready by this time to change the code and adapt the design. In class: finalize working partners for this project. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Step 3</b> (Week 7: Oct. 10)<br/>
Finishing touches & Presentation of final cultural clock projects<br>
